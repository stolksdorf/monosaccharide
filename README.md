# Monosaccharide

> Reduction Tool to shrink exported Sugarcube Interactive Fictions: https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/

*How it works*
When Sugarcube exports, it bundles several very large libraries into the resulting HTML. This is great if you want to run your interactive fiction offline, but it creates a rather large file. This tool replaces those embedded libraries with hosted ones greatly reducing the file size.


*Why the name?*

a Monosaccharide is a _reducing_ sugar, and since this is a minification tool for SugarCube I thought it was quirky and fitting.
